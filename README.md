# Covid-19 Interactive Mapping Project
The goal of this project was to create interactive visualizations of datasets containing information on Covid-19 rates and cases within the US. Both maps employ Mapbox to create a basemap.

 The [Covid rates map]("https://lil-ds.github.io/lsinteractivemapping/map1.html") includes data taken from the [United States Census Bureau]("https://data.census.gov/table?g=0100000US$050000&d=ACS+5-Year+Estimates+Data+Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true"). The primary functions of the map include a choropleth map of rates of Covid in US counties. When hovered, each counties display the number of rates (cases per thousand residents). A description of the county and state name are included in the top left corner.

 The second map, [Covid counts](""https://lil-ds.github.io/lsinteractivemapping/map2.html"") includes a map keeping track of Covid-19 cases in 2020. The data is taken from [NYT]("https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv") and allows a county-level view of Covid-19 cases. This map is a proportional symbols map, allowing the viewer to easily distinguish where larger numbers of cases can be found. It can be noted that more cases were found in California, Florida, and the New York area than anywhere else. By selecting each proportional circle, the number of cases is discripted.
